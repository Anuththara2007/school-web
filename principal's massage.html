                <strong>Principal’s Message</strong><br>
                As the very proud Principal of this outstanding and academically discerning girls’ Buddhist high
                school of Gampaha, Sri Lanka, with a well-respected history of providing excellent educational
                                           outcomes for gifted and talented young women since 1947We support the selected, fortunate young individuals in our school for their wellbeing by
                providing the ideal atmosphere that allows every student to thrive as they work towards
                achieving their best personal performance. Moreover, we set high expectations for our girls and work hard to safeguard positive emotions across our school community, seeking to deepen their knowledge, provide enriching and innovative learning experiences, while also softly urging our girls out of their comfort zone to attempt new challenges of the globalized world.
                I am proud to mention that the school is blessed by an academic staff of 3 deputy principals,
                and an assistant principal and teachers those who readily inspire the students to develop
                creativity, confidence and resilience to become independent and ethical global citizens.
                We instill in our girls a keen social conscience and the capacity to make ethical decisions while
                giving them the opportunities to achieve excellence in academic , extra-curricular and sporting end eavours so that my staff and I, ever focus on encouraging them to develop respectful relationships with their peers, teachers and without a debate, with the broader community too. Good intentions and often valiant efforts of parents, teachers and other well wisher groups such as the School Development Society and the Old Pupils’ Association have also been the precious contributors in our ascent towards success by encouraging and helping us more today, tomorrow and forever.
